## Description
* In this project, we have taken reviews from dataset and built a classifier for predicting the sentiment of a review(positive, negative or neutral) and built a word cloud representing the words of a particular kind of review of a particular brand.
* With this information, the retailer can decide which product to keep and which ones to lay off.
* We used python's sklearn, nltk and wordcloud, pandas and matplotlib libraries for this project.
